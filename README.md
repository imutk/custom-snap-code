This script lets you create a custom SnapCode. All you have to do is enter your username or someone elses username and
then give the colors as hex codes. If the provided username has a Bitmoji, then the Bitmoji will be shown on the
custom SnapCode. If it does not have a Bitmoji, then you will have the default Snapchat ghost on your code.

**Note:** I am aware that this code is messy and the templates for the code make this file unnecessarily large. 
This script is made just to show that this is possible and this method can be used for a future API
